# CS-UY-3113-project # 4
# Name: Sm Shihubullah Dipto
# The main file is the main one that needs to be run
# Instructions:
# Accelerate left, right, up, and down with the left, right, up, and down arrow keys
# Press the arrows multiple times to accelerate more in that direction
# Press space to avtivate the breaks and slow down
# Avoid the enemies and get to the weapon
# that's in the middle
# One enemy diagonally patrols
# Another blocks the path to the weapon
# and dashes towards the player if they
# end up at the same row as the enemy
# The other enemy tracks down
# and moves towards the player
# once the player has entered the same row
# or column as the enemy and therefore
# activates it
# Colliding with one of the enemies without the weapon results in a loss
# When enemies or the player collide with the wall they bounce off
# Colliding with one of the enemies after the weapon has been collected
# destroys that enemy
# Once all enemies have been destroyed, the game is won
# Displays the result of the loss or win on screen as text once the game ends
# To try the game again, the main file needs to be run again
