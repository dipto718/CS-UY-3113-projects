# CS-UY-3113-project # 6
# Name: Sm Shihubullah Dipto
# The main file is the main one that needs to be run
# Instructions:
# Accelerate left, right, up, and down with the left, right, up, and down arrow keys
# Press the arrows multiple times to accelerate more in that direction
# Press space to start the game when on the menu screen
# On each level navigate to the portal
# to get to the next level
# Getting to the portal on the third and final
# level wins the game
# You lose if you collide with 
# one of the moving walls or
# the stationary wall that is
# introduced in level 3
# Colliding with the border walls causes
# the player to bounce and is very likely
# to cause you to lose by then colliding
# into the moving walls or the stationary wall
# From the second level onwards the portal
# will also move which makes control of acceleration
# more important
# That level also introduces the slow tile 
# which is destroyed after collision
# The slow tile cuts your speed in half
# and stops all acceleration.
# Slowing tiles can be both a tool and obstacle by either
# giving the player more control over their speed
# or causing them to be too slow to avoid one of the
# moving walls depending on how the player uses the tile
# The third level also introduces the speed tile which
# is destroyed after collision 
# The speed tile increases you speed by 50%
# and therefore causes you to lose some control
# Hint: use the slowing tiles on the third
# level to regain control
# The third level is extremely hard
# Expect to repeat it a lot of times and lose
# To try the game again, the main file needs to be run again
# So to get to level three again, the first two levels need
# to be done again
# So the player only has one life shared throughout
# the three levels of the game
# The player is made to repeat these levels to better
# understand how to control their speed and acceleration
# in preparation for the final level.
# For instance, level two helps with learning how to
# control turning and use the slowing tile as a tool
# and how the slowing tile can be an obstacle as well
# if there is not enough velocity when it is reached
# Winning this final level results in a win
