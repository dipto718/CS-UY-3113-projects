# CS-UY-3113-project # 2
# Name: Sm Shihubullah Dipto
# The main file is here
# Instructions:
# Press space to start the game
# Press w and s to move the left pad up and down
# Press up and down to move the right pad up and down

# Additional feature added:
# Originally there was a bug in which the pads
# and the ball kept on flickering.
# While trying to remove this bug I found that
# the flickering actually brought more strategy
# into play since the brief flickers required that
# the movement of the ball and to a lesser extent
# each pad be predicted.
# Therefore, instead of getting rid
# of the flickering I instead worked
# to control it and therefore made this
# game of pong have a layer of strategy which
# wasn't there before.
# The only issue with this additional feature
# is that when the game ends when the ball hits
# the left or right side of the screen sometimes
# a black screen is shown instead of the ending
# positions of the pads and the ball if the game
# ended during one of the flickering frames.
