# CS-UY-3113-project # 5
# Name: Sm Shihubullah Dipto
# The main file is the main one that needs to be run
# Instructions:
# The name of the Platformer game is Runner and the goal
# is to get the robot to the end of the stone platform.
# The menu shows the first level of the game along with its name and the fact that
# enter needs to be pressed to start the game.
# More specifically, the enter button on the keypad needs to be pressed (The rightmost enter).
# Press the right or left arrow to increase velocity in that direction repectively.
# Press each button multiple times to further increase the velocity in that direction.
# Press space to jump.
# Making some jumps requires control of both
# velocity and the jump key (space)
# Falling off loses a life and hitting one of the enemies also loses a life.
# If all lives are lost then the game ends in a loss.
# In addition, the loss of a life restarts the current level.
# The number of lives left is displayed when starting or restarting a level.
# When a new level is started or the current level is restarted and there are lives left,
# the left or right arrow needs to be pressed to actually start the level and have it
# focus on the player.
# The game scrolls along with the player.
# The enemies (blue blocks) slam down on the player if the player is under them.
# Colliding with an enemy causes a life to be lost and restarts the current level.
# The enemies slam up as well if the player is above them so that the player can't
# trick an enemy into reaching the ground and then jumping over it.
# When the player is neither above nor below an enemy, the enemy does not move.
# There is looping music that plays and a jump sound is played when jumping is done.
# Displays the result of the loss or win on screen as text once the game ends. The display is on the player sprite.
# To try the game again, the main file needs to be run again
